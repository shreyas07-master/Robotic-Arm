# Robotic-Arm
Role of robotic arm in robotic & automation.


Robotic arm is an fascinating, emerging, familiar technological equipment which plays crucial role in performing the indusrtrial function accurately and perfect outline measurements


It is a versatile device which is implemented to perform heavy load lifing and palletizing capablilties application.


It is best important procession comes with HRI ( Human-Robot interaction ) with excellent electronics & software working platforms.
